# Problem 6

The algorithm is straight forward: two control variables are kept to store the minimum and maximum value so far. The 
input list is traversed once and each element is compared to the control variables.
Being *N* the length of the input list:

* Time complexity: O(N)
* Space complexity: O(1)
